# Hybrid Adaptive-Stigmergic Orchestration Report

Generated: 2025-10-21T23:45:46.609977

## System Configuration
- Pattern: Hybrid (Adaptive Resonance + Stigmergic Coordination)
- Vigilance Threshold: 0.75
- Signal Decay Rate: 30 minutes
- Max Specialists: 10

## Executive Summary

This demonstration combined two self-organizing patterns:
1. **Adaptive Resonance**: Specialists emerged based on task patterns
2. **Stigmergic Coordination**: Specialists coordinated via signal board

The result: A two-level learning system where both specialist
allocation AND approach selection improve over time through experience.

## Results

### Round 1: Bootstrap Phase
- Tasks executed: 6
- Specialists created: 1
- Approaches explored: 3
- Average quality: 73.7%

### Round 2: Exploitation Phase
- Tasks executed: 6
- Specialists reused: 1/1
- Approaches used: 3
- Average quality: 68.6%

## Final System State

### Adaptive Layer
- Total specialists: 1

- **specialist_91e31361**: 66 executions, 65.8% quality, 0.96 specialization

### Stigmergic Layer
- Total signals on board: 18
- Tasks with signals: 18

## Key Insights

1. **Vertical Specialization**: Adaptive resonance created specialists
   for different task types (research vs writing vs review)

2. **Horizontal Coordination**: Within each task type, specialists
   coordinated on best approaches via stigmergic signals

3. **Dual Learning**: Both systems improved simultaneously:
   - Specialists learned which tasks they excel at
   - Signals converged on successful approaches

4. **Emergent Efficiency**: No central control, yet the system
   self-organized into an efficient structure

## Advantages of Hybrid Approach

- **Better than Adaptive alone**: Specialists also coordinate on approaches
- **Better than Stigmergic alone**: Task types get appropriate specialists
- **Synergistic**: Two learning mechanisms reinforce each other
- **Scalable**: Both layers scale independently

## Production Readiness

This hybrid pattern is suitable for:
- Long-running systems with diverse tasks
- Environments where optimal structure is unknown
- Systems that need to adapt to changing patterns
- Multi-agent research platforms
