‚óè Excellent! The hybrid swarm system is showing interesting learning behavior:

  Hybrid Swarm Analysis:

  - ‚úì Reused existing specialist (specialist_2f9d099e_1 with 95% resonance!) - recognized
  similar "writing report" pattern
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Signal attenuated - approach_B signal decreased from 76.1 ‚Üí 53.2 (learning that
  this approach had lower quality 53.5%)
  - üìä Stigmergic learning in action - The swarm is learning which approaches work better

  Now let me provide you with an actual comprehensive report on the Paris Catacombs:

  The Paris Catacombs: An Empire of the Dead

  Executive Summary

  The Paris Catacombs (Les Catacombes de Paris) are an underground ossuary network
  containing the remains of approximately 6 million people. Located beneath the streets of
   Paris, France, this macabre monument stretches for over 300 kilometers of tunnels,
  though only a small section is open to the public. Established in the late 18th century
  to address overflowing cemeteries, the Catacombs have become both a significant tourist
  attraction and a symbol of mortality's intersection with urban development.

  Historical Background

  Origins: The Cemetery Crisis (1780s)

  The Problem:
  - Paris's cemeteries, particularly the Cimeti√®re des Innocents, were overflowing by the
  mid-18th century
  - Bodies were buried in mass graves with insufficient depth
  - Decomposition contaminated groundwater and created severe public health hazards
  - The cemetery walls collapsed in 1780, spilling decomposed bodies into neighboring
  properties

  The Solution:
  - In 1786, the Council of State ordered the closure of Cimeti√®re des Innocents
  - Louis XVI's administration decided to relocate remains to abandoned limestone quarries
  - The quarries had been mined since Roman times for building stone
  - Inspector General of Quarries Charles-Axel Guillaumot was tasked with the project
