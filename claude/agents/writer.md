5. **Transitions**: Connect sections smoothly

### Technical Writing Best Practices
1. **Accuracy first**: Verify all technical claims
2. **Test code**: Ensure all examples work
3. **Explain why**: Don't just show how
4. **Common mistakes**: Highlight pitfalls
5. **Real-world context**: Show practical applications

## Introduction

Python's async/await syntax enables writing concurrent code that handles multiple I/O operations efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamentals with practical, runnable examples.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Core async/await concepts
- Writing and running coroutines
- Concurrent task execution
- Common patterns and pitfalls

**Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of functions and loops

## Understanding Async Basics

Async programming allows your code to perform other work while waiting for I/O operations (network requests, file operations, database queries) to complete.

**Key Concept**: Async provides *concurrency* (handling multiple tasks), not *parallelism* (executing simultaneously).

### When to Use Async

**✅ Good for**:
- Network requests (API calls, web scraping)
- File I/O operations
- Database queries
- Multiple I/O operations that can overlap

**❌ Not for**:
- CPU-intensive calculations
- Simple sequential scripts
- Operations that complete quickly

## Writing Your First Coroutine

A coroutine is an async function defined with `async def`. Let's create one:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    """Simple coroutine that simulates fetching data"""
    print("Starting fetch...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulates I/O delay
    print("Fetch complete!")
    return {"data": "example"}

# To run a coroutine, use asyncio.run()
result = asyncio.run(fetch_data())
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Output**:
```
Starting fetch...
(2 second pause)
Fetch complete!
Result: {'data': 'example'}
```

**Key Points**:
- `async def` creates a coroutine function
- `await` pauses execution until operation completes
- `asyncio.run()` executes the coroutine

### Why This Matters

Without async, this 2-second wait would block the entire program. With async, we can do other work during the wait.

## Running Multiple Tasks Concurrently

The real power of async emerges when running multiple operations concurrently:

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def fetch_url(url: str, delay: int):
    """Simulates fetching a URL with given delay"""
    print(f"Fetching {url}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Completed {url}")
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    """Fetch multiple URLs concurrently"""
    start = time.time()
    
    # Create tasks for concurrent execution
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("api.example.com/1", 2))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("api.example.com/2", 3))
    task3 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("api.example.com/3", 1))
    
    # Wait for all tasks to complete
    results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2, task3)
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"\nAll fetches completed in {elapsed:.1f} seconds")
    print(f"Results: {results}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output**:
```
Fetching api.example.com/1...
Fetching api.example.com/2...
Fetching api.example.com/3...
Completed api.example.com/3
Completed api.example.com/1
Completed api.example.com/2

All fetches completed in 3.0 seconds
Results: ['Data from api.example.com/1', 'Data from api.example.com/2', 'Data from api.example.com/3']
```

**What Happened?**:
- Three "fetches" ran concurrently
- Total time: 3 seconds (the longest individual wait)
- Sequential execution would take 6 seconds (2+3+1)

**Key Points**:
- `asyncio.create_task()` starts concurrent execution
- `asyncio.gather()` waits for all tasks to complete
- Tasks run concurrently, not sequentially

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use create_task() for Concurrency

**❌ Wrong** (runs sequentially):
```python
result1 = await fetch_url("url1", 2)
result2 = await fetch_url("url2", 2)
# Takes 4 seconds total
```

**✅ Correct** (runs concurrently):
```python
task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("url1", 2))
task2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_url("url2", 2))
results = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
# Takes 2 seconds total
```

### 2. Use Async Context Managers

For resources like files or connections:

```python
async with aiofiles.open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = await f.read()
# File automatically closed
```

### 3. Handle Errors in Tasks

```python
async def safe_fetch(url):
    try:
        return await fetch_url(url, 2)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
        return None
```

### 4. Don't Block the Event Loop

**❌ Wrong** (blocks event loop):
```python
async def bad_example():
    time.sleep(2)  # Blocks everything!
```

**✅ Correct** (allows concurrency):
```python
async def good_example():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Allows other tasks to run
```

## Summary

You've learned the fundamentals of async/await in Python:

**Key Takeaways**:
- Use `async def` to create coroutines
- Use `await` to pause for async operations
- Use `asyncio.create_task()` for concurrent execution
- Use `asyncio.gather()` to wait for multiple tasks
- Async is for I/O-bound operations, not CPU-bound

**Next Steps**:
1. Practice writing your own coroutines
2. Try fetching real URLs with `aiohttp`
3. Explore error handling patterns
4. Learn about asyncio synchronization primitives
