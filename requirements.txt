# Hybrid Swarm Orchestration System - Dependencies

# Optional: For adaptive resonance vector operations
# The system works without numpy, but vector similarity calculations
# are more efficient with it
numpy>=1.20.0

# Note: Core functionality uses Python standard library only
# numpy is only required for src/adaptive_resonance.py

# Install with:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or skip if you want stdlib-only operation:
# The system will work but may be slightly less efficient
